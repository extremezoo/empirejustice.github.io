                <dd class="dl">Used as an alternative to foreclosure, a deed in lieu of foreclosure is where you sign over the deed to your property to the lender because you are unable to make your mortgage payments. May also be referred to as deed in lieu or 'voluntary conveyance.' A deed in lieu of foreclosure will have a negative impact on your credit.</dd>

                <dd class="defer">If you are facing a temporary hardship, your lender may offer you a deferment.  A deferment is a postponement of your home loan payments for a set period of time.  This does not release you from having to pay interest on those amounts, but you can defer or postpone having to make those payments for an agreed-upon number of months as temporary relief during a hardship period.  After that period is over, your lender will work with you to develop a repayment plan that allows you to make your regularly scheduled mortgage payments plus pay off these deferred payments over time.</dd>

The sooner you take action by contacting your bank, the more options you&rsquo;ll have available to you.</dd>

                    If you can no longer afford to make your mortgage payments and your house is worth less than you owe, a short sale allows you to sell your house at the current fair market value. You then have the option to move to a more affordable situation. Because the proceeds from the sale may not pay off all that you owe, the investor or owner of your loan must approve the sale. Depending on your situation, you may be eligible for a deficiency waiver. In that case, you will not be required to repay any remaining loan balance after the sale.
                    <br /><br />
                    When putting your house on the market, the goal is to market and sell your house for an amount greater than any and all outstanding liens against the property. Liens include all mortgages, escrows and fees on the property. For further clarification on liens and related restrictions, please contact a licensed real estate agent.
