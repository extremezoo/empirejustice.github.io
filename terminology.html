			<dt>Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure or Deed in Lieu</dt>
			<dd>Used as an alternative to foreclosure, a deed in lieu of foreclosure is where you sign over the deed to your property to the lender because you are unable to make your mortgage payments. May also be referred to as deed in lieu or 'voluntary conveyance.' A deed in lieu of foreclosure will have a negative impact on your credit.</dd>

			<dd>If you are facing a temporary hardship, your lender may offer you a deferment.  A deferment is a postponement of your home loan payments for a set period of time.  This does not release you from having to pay interest on those amounts, but you can defer or postpone having to make those payments for an agreed-upon number of months as temporary relief during a hardship period.

Being in the &#8220;delinquency cycle&#8221; does not automatically mean you&rsquo;ll lose your home to foreclosure.  This is a crucial time to reach out and get help.
