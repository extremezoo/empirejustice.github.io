# How to Contribute

We're always looking for new ideas and help with writing code.
We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that
will enhance this application. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue/feature request, assuming one does not already exist. (Searching first is recommended)
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.

## Making Changes

* Fork the repository on GitHub
* Switch to the DEV branch.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a Pull Request to the repository in the empirejustice organization to the DEV branch. (Pull Requests made to Master will not be accepted, ever)
* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
