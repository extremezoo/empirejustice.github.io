                <div> In New York, the lenders go to court in what is known as a judicial foreclosure proceeding where the court must issue a final judgment of foreclosure. The property is then sold as part of a publicly noticed sale. The court with jurisdiction over a foreclosure is known as the Supreme Court in the county in which the property is located. A foreclosure complaint involving a property in Manhattan would be filed in the Supreme Court of New York: New York County. A complaint is filed in this court along with what is known a lis pendens. A lis pendens is a recorded document that provides public notice that the property is being foreclosed upon.

                <div> Depending on the court schedule, it usually takes approximately 120-180 days to effectuate an uncontested foreclosure.

This means that the borrower still owes the lender for the difference between what the property sold for at auction and the amount of the original loan. The Plaintiff must file a motion within 90 days after the property sale auction to enforce this right.
